## Generating image URLs for your site. How!

Ahoy! Itâ€™s my third post this week and I would like to share my experience using the **inline** feature on **@HASHNODE** for uploading images.

Okay so when I publish my first post on @hashnode

I needed  images based on my article, images that would be published with my article.

I needed a URL for my image

Basically... We could just go on Google and then we check out an image, copy the link and embed in our post. 
This idea actually works fine but didn't work for me
Why!! The images were designed by me, I created it. They were not on the web.

So I went out on Google
Then I stumbled upon this site on Googles first page 

ðŸ‘‰ [ImageKit](https://Imagekit.io)

Wow the perfect tool have been looking for, I just needed URLs for my images directly from the web. 


**Trust me! Itâ€™s a cool method you would love to give out a try to.**

>So Sit Tight. Read and Enjoy!

Images are important part of the content of a website to instantly grab viewersâ€™ attention and entice them in! We all get attracted when we see something nice, so we could just go ahead and give it a click.
 Images are the most efficient means to showcase a website, a service or a product. They make up for most of the visual contents on your site. 

But, the more images a website has the more bandwidth it consumes, affecting the page load speed.

## ImageKit-The Tool I Used.

[ImageKit](https://Imagekit.io) is a tool that can be used for image optimization and transformation with minimal effort. It is a complete image CDN with optimization and transformation capabilities for images on websites.

**Now! What do I mean? **

Feed [ImageKit](https://Imagekit.io) an original, un-optimized image and fetch it using an ImageKit URL, and it shall deliver an optimized image, rightly resized image to your site viewers devices! 
**An example would do right?**

```
https:/ik.imagekit.io/myimage/img/tr:w-600,h-400/default-image.jpg ```

Here, the width and height of the final image was specified with W and H parameters in the URL. The output of the image as an attached dimension of 300Ã—100px. The resized image scaled down from an original size of 500Ã—500px.

ImageKit! Itâ€™s also has a cool feature that helps with maximizing your websiteâ€™s bandwidth consumption.

**For instance, the following image**

![here](https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ik-01.jpg?ssl=1)

Its almost 2.5x the size of its JPG variant.
ImageKit automatically gives you an output of the correct image format on image content, image quality, browser support, and your viewerâ€™s device capability. 
Also the tool will automatically converts your image to a WebP image format and delivered as a WebP for all browsers supporting the WebP image format.
